## Project Overview
This project is a React application designed to list drivers and menu items from provided JSON data files. It allows users to:
- View a list of drivers with details about their weekly activity.
- View menu items from a data file.
- Search for drivers by name or vehicle registration.
- Filter activity information by day of the week, showing if drivers had activities on a particular day.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool:**   Create React App
- **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for UI development
- **Other Tools:**  Prettier

## Future Considerations

- Include a LogIn/SignUp capabilities
- Manage vehicles and drivers (CRUD operations)
 - Consider server server-side -rendering (SSR) 
- Use TypeScript to add static typic e.g. 
``` bash
type Driver = {
  name: string;
  registration: string;
  activityMinutes: number;
  days: string[];
};
```
